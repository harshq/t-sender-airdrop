# ðŸª‚ T-Sender Airdrop

**T-Sender Airdrop** is a full-stack monorepo for simulating and managing ERC-20 token airdrops. It combines a smart contract project built with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and a modern [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web application for interacting with the airdrop via a user-friendly UI.
